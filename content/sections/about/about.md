I am a Transactional Fraud Analyst at Zappos.com looking to follow my passion into a career in tech.

During my time at Zappos, I have participated in a mini Front End Bootcamp, worked as a Manual QA Apprentice, and am always on the hunt to create the next tool or automated process for my team.

As a QA Apprentice, I tested our bottom funnel experience (cart, checkout, and account pages) and took part in the development cycle of 3+ major features. I also learned to write automated test scripts in JavaScript and deployed our subsidiary websites via AWS and Jenkins.

After finishing my QA program, I wanted to double down on my career, and that led me to the full stack Java program from which I graduated in November 2022.

I am now looking for my first tech role as a developer and appreciate you taking a look at my projects below.
